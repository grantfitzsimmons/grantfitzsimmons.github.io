<h3 class="Header1">The Strokes</h3>
<p>The Strokes arrived in the early â€˜00s during New York's rock revival, delivering one of the era's most remarkable debut albums with Is This It. Heavily influenced by fellow New Yorkers Television and The Velvet Underground, the record kicked off the decade's fixation with garage rock and established the fashionable Julian Casablancas as one of his generation's coolest frontmen. The band never quite reached the same heights again, but forays into New Wave on 2003's Room On Fire and slick power-pop on 2011's Angles proved they were far from one-trick ponies.</p>
<p>The Strokes are an American rock band from New York City. Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer Julian Casablancas, lead guitarist Nick Valensi, rhythm guitarist Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. </p>
