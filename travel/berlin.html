<h2 class="subtitle">History of Berlin</h2>
<p class="subtext">Berlin was founded in the 13th century and became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1417. From there, it became the capital of Brandenburg-Prussia and then the Kingdom of Prussia as the empire expanded. Over the 18th and 19th centuries, Prussia grew and became the early German Empire in 1871. It became a major world city, known for higher education, science, the humanities, music, museums, government, diplomacy and military affairs. It was nearly completely destroyed during World War II and became split between the victors of the war. After Germany was reunified in 1990 it became the capital once again.</p>
